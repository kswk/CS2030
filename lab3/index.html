<h2>Problem Description</h2>
<p>
In this lab, we are going to explore different design options for modeling 3D objects.  In particular, we wish to model different 3D shapes.  We can compute the volume and surface area of a given shape.  For each shape, there is a possibility that the shape is solid with a given density.  From the density and the volume, we can compute its mass.
</p>
<p>
For instance, a cuboid is a box-shaped object having six flat sides with all right-angled corners. From the three sides of the solid cuboid, one can compute the volume and surface area. In addition, a solid cuboid object is made up of a specific material, and by using the density of the material, the mass can be found.
</p>

<h2>Task</h2>
<p>
By using object-oriented modeling and applying the abstraction principle, design two different sets of classes/interfaces to facilitate the creation of a 3D shape and a solid 3D shape, starting with a cuboid and solid cuboid. Show how you can obtain the cuboid's volume, density as well as mass. Extend this concept to deal with other possible 3D shapes such as a sphere.
</p>
<p>
Your design should contain as little repetition of code (including method implementation and member declaration) as possible.

<h2>Level 1</h2>
<h2>Represent a Cuboid</h2>
<p>
Create an <em>immutable</em> class <code>Cuboid</code>. Its constructor has three parameters height, width, and length (in that order). All are of type double. Like all 3D shapes, <code>Cuboid</code> has a method <code>getVolume()</code> and <code>getSurfaceArea()</code>.  The class has three new methods: <code>Cuboid setHeight(double height)</code>, <code>Cuboid setWidth(double width)</code>, and <code>Cuboid setLength(double length)</code>.
</p>
<p>
The string representation of a <code>Cuboid</code> is in the form:
<pre>
Cuboid [Height x Width x Length]
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Height, Width, and Length will be to 2 decimal places. Recall from lab 1, the <code>toString()</code> method in the Point class.

<h2>Level 3</h2>

Create an <em>immutable</em> class <code>Sphere</code>, its constructor has one parameter radius of type double. The class has one new method: Sphere <code>setRadius(double radius)</code>.

The string representation of a <code>Sphere</code> is in the form:

<h2>Level 5</h2>
<h2>SolidShape3D using Composition</h2>
<p>
You should see that it is not easy to model the four classes, <code>Cuboid</code>, <code>SolidCuboid</code>, <code>Sphere</code>, and <code>SolidSphere</code>, above without some repetition of code, violating the abstraction principles.  In this level, we will explore a different design.
</p>
<p>
A density is really a property of a material not of a shape. Let's create a <code>Material</code> class, with a constructor that takes in two parameters, the name of the material and the density of the material. The first term is a string and the second term is a double.
</p>
<p>
What if we created a new class that contains both a <code>Shape3D</code> and a <code>Material</code>. Implement a class <code>SolidShape3D</code> which has a constructor that takes in a <code>Shape3D</code> and a <code>Material</code> (in that order). The class should implement a <code>double getMass()</code> and <code>double getDensity()</code> methods.
</p>
<p>
Would this <code>SolidShape3D</code> class still work if we created a new class <code>Prism</code> that inherits from <code>Shape3D</code>?
